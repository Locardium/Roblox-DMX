# Roblox DMX

This is a simple code I made to connect GrandMA2 through Art-Net (DMX) to Roblox Studio.



## How this work

The program written in javascript collects the DMX signal and sends it to a web, after that Roblox get the information from the web and sends the data to the fixtures


## Installation

Connect the MA2 to the selected Art-Net. If you have done it correctly you should see numbers in http://localhost:80/

Add the .rbxm file to Roblox Studio and launch it.

Note: Use only in Roblox Studio, the script works by HTTP that means that it will not have a good performance and it would worsen if it was used outside of Roblox Studio.

Fixtures: 
- Beams = Clay Paky | Sharpy Standard | Lamp off
- Strobes = Astera LED Technology | AX10 Spotmax | DIM RGB S - Strobe off
